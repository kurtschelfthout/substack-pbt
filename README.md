# MiniPBT

This is the example code for the series of posts on property-based testing on my Substack, [Get Code](https://getcode.substack.com/). Altogether it's an implementation of a minimal property-based testing library, designed for simplicity and readability.

I've tested it with Python 3.9, no other dependencies necessary.
